# DC1
Hello everyone,
If you have reached this you are probably looking to build a really cool 2" x 72" belt grinder. 

This project consists of multiple files including a CAD drawing, bills of materials and DC1 Belt Grinder. We strongly encourage innovation and modifications to meet your needs. Really, we'd like to get some files back if you make some changes so your changes can be shared with the world.
